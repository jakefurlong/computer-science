# Computer Science Degree Equivalent

I found a free, open source, online equivalent to a bachelor's degree in computer science: [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). I majored in business in college which has served me very well thus far; however, I still felt that, as a self-taught engineer/developer, there were significant gaps in my knowledge. I embarked on a journey to complete all of the content recommended by OSSU. This repository serves as a proof source for those looking to validate my knowledge/skills acquired through a traditional computer science education.

## Prerequisites

High School Math: the requirement can be met by taking algebra, geometry, and precalculus at the high school level. It's been about 25 years since I took those classes in high school so I decided to refresh my maths knowledge. I can do so by taking the courses on Khan Academy:

- Arithmetics
- Basic Geometry
- Pre-algebra
- Integrated Math 1
- Integrated Math 2
- Integrated Math 3

KA just restructured all of their content so I will have to go back and re-complete all of these sections. Once finished, I will post screenshots here to provide some sort of artifact to support my proof of completition.
